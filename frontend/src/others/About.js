                <div className='pt-4'>I see this web application as a real-life project in which I applied my technical skills I have learned since I chose to be a web developer to make an online store.
                 About two months of my full-time work filled with pure passion resulted in this web application. Even though it is just a personal project, it has almost all advanced features of a real-life online store.
                There are still a lot of things to work on to make it better. I would love to listen to your feedback on my project.
                Let's make things together.
